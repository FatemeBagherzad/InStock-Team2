# InStock Project

We have experienced team work in InStock project.<br/>
It was a great experience for us and it will drive us for further works.

In this project we practiced chunking an existing<br/>
site into React components and converting an<br/>
existing static site into a React app.<br/>
Also we used and practiced with database for the first time.<br/>

**Update1**: We have added functional Search bar to our app🥳<br/> -
**Update2**: I have added sorting functionality to the app<br/>
which is running and filtering data fron client side😊<br/>
we hope we can implement this functionality from server side too<br/>

**Update3**: We have added error handling functions<br/>
for all form which was very challenging💥.
